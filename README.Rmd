The goal of cwtCensus is to provide a fast and memory efficient tool for cohort reconstruction using point and bootstrapped estimates. Writing efficient code for cohort reconstruction can be challenging, so we developed cwtCensus to abstract away the details of tweaking lines of R and designing algorithms. With this package, you can generate bootstrapped and non-bootstrapped cohort reconstructions with just one click!

## Installation

You can install the latest stable version of cwtCensus from CRAN with:

``` r
install.packages("cwtCensus")
```

You can install the development version of cwtCensus from [GitHub](https://github.com/J-Ch-n/cwtCensus/tree/main) with:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("J-Ch-n/cwtCensus")
```

## Example

This is a basic example showing you how to solve a common cohort reconstruction problem:

```{r}
library(cwtCensus)
set.seed(998784)
```

Creating a cohort reconstruction with point estimates:

```{r}
result = cohort_reconstruct(release, recovery, birth_month = 4L,
  bootstrap = FALSE, last_month = 12L, iter = 10L,
  level = 0.95, detail = FALSE, sex = "both", verbose = FALSE)
```

Time spent on generating point estimate cohort reconstruction:

```{r}
cohort_reconstruct(release, recovery, birth_month = 4L,
  bootstrap = FALSE, last_month = 12L, iter = 10L,
  level = 0.95, detail = FALSE, sex = "both", verbose = FALSE) |> system.time()
```

Viewing the 1998 brood year age 3 cohort in June:

```{r}
result[result$by == 2007 & result$age == 3 & result$month == 6] |> unlist()
```

Creating a bootstrapped cohort reconstruction with 1000 iterations:

```{r}
result = cohort_reconstruct(release, recovery, birth_month = 4L,
  bootstrap = TRUE, last_month = 12L, iter = 1000L,
  level = 0.95, detail = TRUE, sex = "both", verbose = FALSE)
```

Viewing the bootstrapped summary of 2007 brood year age 3 cohort in June:

```{r}
result[["2007"]][["3"]][["6"]][["summary"]]
```

Time spent on generating bootstrapped cohort reconstruction with 1000 iterations:

```{r}
cohort_reconstruct(release, recovery, birth_month = 4L,
  bootstrap = TRUE, last_month = 12L, iter = 1000L,
  level = 0.95, detail = TRUE, sex = "both", verbose = FALSE) |> system.time()
```
